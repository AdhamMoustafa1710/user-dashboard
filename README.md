- Implements pagination for efficient data loading
- Uses RxJS observables for handling asynchronous operations

### User Interface:
- Responsive design with a header and centered user list
- Styling and animations for an enhanced visual experience

### Development Considerations:
- Built on Angular 7+ using Angular CLI
- Well-documented and structured codebase
- Emphasis on code quality and best practices

This project combines modern web development techniques with user-centric design to create a robust and efficient user management dashboard. It focuses on delivering a smooth user experience while maintaining high performance and code quality standards.
